## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Hania** and I'm a programming student at **Hive Helsinki** :wave:

I'm currently working on the **Webserv**, a 42 curriculum project, where you build a web server from scratch.  
This is a moment when I leave **C** (is it farewell or is it goodbye?) and focus on **C++** â€” quite an adjustment, but a great learning opportunity!

ðŸ‘‰ To see my C++ efforts, visit the [42-CPP repository](https://github.com/huskyhania/42-CPPModules)

### Interested in what I did in C?

ðŸ‘‰ Have a look at **[Philosophers](https://github.com/huskyhania/philosophers)** â€” I implemented two different solutions to the classic *Dining Philosophers* problem:  
â€¢ one using threads and mutexes  
â€¢ one using processes and semaphores  

ðŸ‘‰ Wanna see something really pretty? Go to **[Fract-ol](https://github.com/huskyhania/fractol)** â€” A small graphical project that lets you explore the beauty of **Mandelbrot**, **Julia**, and **Burning Ship** fractals, in all colors of the rainbow ðŸŒˆ or black and white.
