## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Hania** and I'm a programming student at **Hive Helsinki** :wave:

I'm currently wraping up my school projects.  
This is a moment when I leave **C** and **C++** (is it farewell or is it goodbye?) â€” and start thinking what's next. 

ðŸ‘‰ Look at a web server implementation, done from scratch in C++ **[Webserver](https://github.com/huskyhania/42-webserv)** 

ðŸ‘‰ To see my C++ efforts, visit the [42-CPP repository](https://github.com/huskyhania/42-CPPModules)

### I've also just started learning Python!
ðŸ‘‰ Visit **[100 Days of Code - Python](https://github.com/huskyhania/100-Days-of-Code-Python)** - You can see my progress with The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Angela Yu.

It's not much (yet!) but it's honest work ðŸ˜…

ðŸ‘‰ Check out **[Wordle Solver and co](https://github.com/huskyhania/WordleSolver)** - A couple of cool, small programs based on the Wordle game:

â€¢ 3 different solving programs  
â€¢ terminal-based Wordle implementation  
â€¢ auto-solver

### Interested in what I did in C?

ðŸ‘‰ My biggest achievement AKA **[Minishell](https://github.com/huskyhania/minishell)** - A thorough implementation of a command interpreter that closely mimics the behaviour of Bash. It was a deep dive into processes and system calls that taught me more than any other project.

ðŸ‘‰ Have a look at **[Philosophers](https://github.com/huskyhania/philosophers)** â€” I implemented two different solutions to the classic *Dining Philosophers* problem:  
â€¢ one using threads and mutexes  
â€¢ one using processes and semaphores  

ðŸ‘‰ Wanna see something really pretty? Go to **[Fract-ol](https://github.com/huskyhania/fractol)** â€” A small graphical project that lets you explore the beauty of **Mandelbrot**, **Julia**, and **Burning Ship** fractals, in all colors of the rainbow ðŸŒˆ or black and white.
